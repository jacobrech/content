**Eager loading** is a strategy that loads all assets (e.g., images) as soon as possible, regardless of whether the user needs them immediately. It is the opposite of {{Glossary("lazy load","Lazy load")}}.

This approach ensures that all necessary assets are available upfront, reducing delays when interacting with the page, but it might worsen the initial load performance since more resources are loaded upfront.
